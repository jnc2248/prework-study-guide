        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the most basic building block of websites. It handles the content of a website, as well as its structure and the meaning of each element on the page.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets (< >).</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body elements include: "p" for paragraph or block of text, "img" for an image, "br" for empty lines of space.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language used to describe the presentation of a website that is created with HTML and how each element on a webpage is rendered.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>We use the add -A command to commit all files in the working branch.</li>
          <li>We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented.</li>
          <li>To make sure that our current branch is up to date before opening a pull request, use: git pull origin main.</li>
          <li>Git is a free, open source version control system that allows web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work. It also allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code if a problem is discovered.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work!</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
